abstract = {Being able to build a map of the environment and to simultaneously localize within this map is an essential skill for mobile robots navigating in unknown environments in absence of external referencing systems such as GPS. This so-called simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem has been one of the most popular research topics in mobile robotics for the last two decades and efficient approaches for solving this task have been proposed. One intuitive way of formulating SLAM is to use a graph whose nodes correspond to the poses of the robot at different points in time and whose edges represent constraints between the poses. The latter are obtained from observations of the environment or from movement actions carried out by the robot. Once such a graph is constructed, the map can be computed by finding the spatial configuration of the nodes that is mostly consistent with the measurements modeled by the edges. In this paper, we provide an introductory description to the graph-based SLAM problem. Furthermore, we discuss a state-of-the-art solution that is based on least-squares error minimization and exploits the structure of the SLAM problems during optimization. The goal of this tutorial is to enable the reader to implement the proposed methods from scratch.},

@article{Montemerlo2002,
abstract = {The ability to simultaneously localize a robot and accurately map its surroundings is considered by many to be a key prerequisite of truly autonomous robots. However, few approaches to this problem scale up to handle the very large number of landmarks present in real environments. Kalman filter-based algorithms, for example, require time quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate each sensor observation. This paper presents FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on a factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional landmark distributions and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of previous approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the FastSLAM algorithm on both simulated and real-world data.},

abstract = {Exact knowledge of the position of a vehicle is a fundamental problem in mobile robot appli-cations. In search for a solution, researchers and engineers have developed a variety of systems, sensors, and techniques for mobile robot positioning. This paper provides a review of relevant mobile robot positioning technologies. The paper defines seven categories for positioning sys-tems: 1. Odometry; 2. Inertial Navigation; 3. Magnetic Compasses; 4. Active Beacons; 5. Global Positioning Systems; 6. Landmark Navigation; and 7. Model Matching. The characteristics of each category are discussed and examples of existing technologies are given for each category. The field of mobile robot navigation is active and vibrant, with more great systems and ideas being developed continuously. For this reason the examples presented in this paper serve only to represent their respective categories, but they do not represent a judgment by the authors. Many ingenious approaches can be found in the literature, although, for reasons of brevity, not all could be cited in this paper.},

Guidance, navigation and motion control systems for autonomous vehicles are increasingly important in land-based, marine and aerial operations. Autonomous underwater vehicles may be used for pipeline inspection, light intervention work, underwater survey and collection of oceanographic/biological data. Autonomous unmanned aerial systems can be used in a large number of applications such as inspection, monitoring, data collection, surveillance, etc. At present, vehicles operate with limited autonomy and a minimum of intelligence. There is a growing interest for cooperative and coordinated multi-vehicle systems, real-time re-planning, robust autonomous navigation systems and robust autonomous control of vehicles. Unmanned vehicles with high levels of autonomy may be used for safe and efficient collection of environmental data, for assimilation of climate and environmental models and to complement global satellite systems. The target audience primarily comprises research experts in the field of control theory, but the book may also be beneficial for graduate students.

abstract = {Simulators have played a critical role in robotics research as tools for quick and efficient testing of new concepts, strategies, and algorithms. To date, most simulators have been restricted to 2D worlds, and few have matured to the point where they are both highly capable and easily adaptable. Gazebo is designed to fill this niche by creating a 3D dynamic multi-robot environment capable of recreating the complex worlds that would be encountered by the next generation of mobile robots. Its open source status, fine grained control, and high fidelity place Gazebo in a unique position to become more than just a stepping stone between the drawing board and real hardware: data visualization, simulation of remote environments, and even reverse engineering of blackbox systems are all possible applications. Gazebo is developed in cooperation with the Player and Stage projects (Gerkey, B. P., et al., July 2003), (Gerkey, B. P., et al., May 2001), (Vaughan, R.

abstract = {Urban performance currently depends not only on a city's endowment of hard infrastructure (physical capital), but also, and increasingly so, on the availability and quality of knowledge communication and social infrastructure (human and social capital). The latter form of capital is decisive for urban competitiveness. Against this background, the concept of the "smart city" has recently been introduced as a strategic device to encompass modern urban production factors in a common framework and, in particular, to highlight the importance of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the last 20 years for enhancing the competitive profile of a city. The present paper aims to shed light on the often elusive definition of the concept of the "smart city." We provide a focused and operational definition of this construct and present consistent evidence on the geography of smart cities in the EU27. Our statistical and graphical analyses exploit in depth, for the first time to our knowledge, the most recent version of the Urban Audit data set in order to analyze the factors determining the performance of smart cities. We find that the presence of a creative class, the quality of and dedicated attention to the urban environment, the level of education, and the accessibility to and use of ICTs for public administration are all positively correlated with urban wealth. This result prompts the formulation of a new strategic agenda for European cities that will allow them to achieve sustainable urban development and a better urban landscape. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The Society of Urban Technology.},

abstract = {This paper presents preliminary findings from a big data analysis and GIS to identify the efficiency of waste management and transportation in the City of Stockholm. The aim of this paper is to identify inefficiencies in waste collection routes in the city of Stockholm, and to suggest potential improvements. Based on a large data set consisting of roughly half a million entries of waste fractions, weights, and locations, a series of new waste generation maps was developed. This was the outcome of an extensive data curation process, followed by batch geocoding of the curated entries. Thereafter, the maps were generated that describe what waste fraction comes from where and how it is collected. Finally, a preliminary analysis of the route efficiency was conducted. Maps of selected vehicle routes were constructed in detail and the efficiencies of the routes for the first half of July 2013 were assessed using the efficiency index (kg waste/km). It is concluded that substantial inefficiencies were revealed, and a number of intervention measures are discussed to increase the efficiency of waste management, including a shared waste collection vehicle fleet.},

abstract = {This report documents a new study of public opinion about self-driving vehicles in China, India, and Japan. The survey yielded completed responses from 610 respondents in China, 527 respondents in India, and 585 respondents in Japan. For comparison, the report also includes recently released findings from the same survey in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia. The main findings (applicable to each of the six countries) are as follows: ? The majority of respondents had previously heard of autonomous or self-driving vehicles, had a positive initial opinion of the technology (or neutral in the case of Japan), and had high expectations about the benefits of the technology. ? However, the majority of respondents expressed high levels of concern about riding in self- driving vehicles, safety issues related to equipment or system failure, and self-driving vehicles not performing as well as human drivers. ? Respondents also expressed high levels of concern about vehicles without driver controls; self- driving vehicles moving while unoccupied; and self-driving commercial vehicles, buses, and taxis. ? The majority of respondents expressed a desire to have this technology in their vehicles. However, a majority was also unwilling to pay extra for the technology (except for respondents in China and India). In comparison to the respondents in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia, respondents in China and India had more positive initial opinions of self-driving vehicles, expressed greater interest in having such technology on their personal vehicles, and were willing to pay the most for it. Japanese respondents, on the other hand, generally had more neutral initial opinions about self-driving technology and were willing to pay the least for it. The main implications of these results are that the respondents in the six countries surveyed, while expressing high levels of concern about riding in vehicles equipped with this technology, mostly feel positive about self-driving vehicles, have optimistic expectations of the benefits, and generally desire self-driving-vehicle technology (though a majority in four out of the six countries surveyed are not willing to pay extra for such technology at this time).},

abstract = {1 2 Self-driving vehicles represent a technological leap forward that can offer solutions to current 3 transportation problems and dramatically change how people approach mobility. While self-4 driving cars have the potential to improve safety and increase quality of life, many people appear 5 reluctant to adopt the technology, because they are uncomfortable with safety, liabilities, and 6 control. Public attitudes toward self-driving cars are increasingly important as the public shapes 7 the demand for the technology, policies that govern them, and future investments in 8 infrastructure. Moreover the nature of the technology means that the truly transformative benefits 9 are only realized once self-driving cars are adopted en masse. We investigate public attitudes 10 toward self-driving cars using the responses of 107 likely adopters in Berkeley, California as a 11 case study. What do these people find most and least attractive about self-driving cars, and how 12 do they envision the inclusion of the technology? Would they adopt this technology and in what 13 form? Do an individual's demographics, existing travel behavior, and relationship to cars and 14 technology affect his or her opinion about self-driving cars? We find that individuals are most 15 attracted to potential safety benefits, the convenience of not having to find parking, and 16 amenities such as multitasking while en route; conversely, individuals were most concerned with 17 liability, the cost of the technology, and losing control of the vehicle. Men are more likely to be 18 concerned with liability, and less likely to be concerned with control than women. Individuals 19 with higher income are most concerned with liability, and those with lower income appear to be 20 more concerned with safety and control. Single-occupancy vehicle commuters and cyclists were 21 most concerned with giving up control. All groups were concerned with costs. We present this 22 case study to inform those creating this technology how self-driving cars will likely be perceived 23 by the public. 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 TRB 2014 Annual Meeting Paper revised from original submittal.},

@article{Talebpour2016,
abstract = {The introduction of connected and autonomous vehicles will bring changes to the highway driving environment. Connected vehicle technology provides real-time information about the surrounding traffic condition and the traffic management center's decisions. Such information is expected to improve drivers' efficiency, response, and comfort while enhancing safety and mobility. Connected vehicle technology can also further increase efficiency and reliability of autonomous vehicles, though these vehicles could be operated solely with their on-board sensors, without communication. While several studies have examined the possible effects of connected and autonomous vehicles on the driving environment, most of the modeling approaches in the literature do not distinguish between connectivity and automation, leaving many questions unanswered regarding the implications of different contemplated deployment scenarios. There is need for a comprehensive acceleration framework that distinguishes between these two technologies while modeling the new connected environment. This study presents a framework that utilizes different models with technology-appropriate assumptions to simulate different vehicle types with distinct communication capabilities. The stability analysis of the resulting traffic stream behavior using this framework is presented for different market penetration rates of connected and autonomous vehicles. The analysis reveals that connected and autonomous vehicles can improve string stability. Moreover, automation is found to be more effective in preventing shockwave formation and propagation under the model's assumptions. In addition to stability, the effects of these technologies on throughput are explored, suggesting substantial potential throughput increases under certain penetration scenarios.},

abstract = {This study gains insight into individual motivations for choosing to own and use autonomous vehicles and develops a model for autonomous vehicle long-term choice decisions. A stated preference questionnaire is distributed to 721 individuals living across Israel and North America. Based on the characteristics of their current commutes, individuals are presented with various scenarios and asked to choose the car they would use for their commute. A vehicle choice model which includes three options is estimated:(1)Continue to commute using a regular car that you have in your possession.(2)Buy and shift to commuting using a privately-owned autonomous vehicle (PAV).(3)Shift to using a shared-autonomous vehicle (SAV), from a fleet of on-demand cars for your commute.A factor analysis determined five relevant latent variables describing the individuals' attitudes: technology interest, environmental concern, enjoy driving, public transit attitude, and pro-AV sentiments. The effects that the characteristics of the individual and the autonomous vehicle have on use and acceptance are quantified through random utility models including logit kernel model taking into account panel effects. Currently, large overall hesitations towards autonomous vehicle adoption exist, with 44{\%} of choice decisions remaining regular vehicles. Early AV adopters will likely be young, students, more educated, and spend more time in vehicles. Even if the SAV service were to be completely free, only 75{\%} of individuals would currently be willing to use SAVs. The study also found various differences regarding the preferences of individuals in Israel and North America, namely that Israelis are overall more likely to shift to autonomous vehicles. Methods to encourage SAV use include increasing the costs for regular cars as well as educating the public about the benefits of shared autonomous vehicles.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent a potentially disruptive yet beneficial change to our transportation system. This new technology has the potential to impact vehicle safety, congestion, and travel behavior. All told, major social AV impacts in the form of crash savings, travel time reduction, fuel efficiency and parking benefits are estimated to approach {\$}2000 to per year per AV, and may eventually approach nearly {\$}4000 when comprehensive crash costs are accounted for. Yet barriers to implementation and mass-market penetration remain. Initial costs will likely be unaffordable. Licensing and testing standards in the U.S. are being developed at the state level, rather than nationally, which may lead to inconsistencies across states. Liability details remain undefined, security concerns linger, and without new privacy standards, a default lack of privacy for personal travel may become the norm. The impacts and interactions with other components of the transportation system, as well as implementation details, remain uncertain. To address these concerns, the federal government should expand research in these areas and create a nationally recognized licensing framework for AVs, determining appropriate standards for liability, security, and data privacy.},

This sensor is mounted in front of a vehicle. The basic idea is to first determine 2-D visual targets in intensity images of the camera. The range finder is then used not only to confirm or reject the real existence of the detected visual targets but also to acquire 3-D information of the confirmed visual targets. The central problem of this strategy is the method of detection of 2-D visual targets from intensity images of a road scene. In the method, line segments are considered as significant features. The concept of a line segment of interest and the concept of a dominant line segment are used. Two-imensional visual targets can be effectively determined with the help of the identification of the dominant line segments in an image. The range finder was used to confirm or reject a 2-D visual target},

Our mission at Boston Dynamics is to develop a new breed of rough-terrain robots that capture the mobility, autonomy and speed of living creatures. Such robots will travel in outdoor terrain that is too steep, rutted, rocky, wet, muddy, and snowy for conventional vehicles. They will also travel in cities and in our homes, doing chores and providing care, where steps, stairways and household clutter limit the utility of wheeled vehicles. Robots meeting these goals will have terrain sensors, sophisticated computing and power systems, advanced actuators and dynamic controls. I will give a status report on BigDog, an example of such rough-terrain robots. It is a 100 kg quadruped robot that balances actively as it operates on a variety of outdoor terrains, carries a 65 kg load, runs travels at up to 11 kph.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. There could be no smart city without a reliable and efficient transportation system. This necessity makes the ITS a key component of any smart city concept. While legacy ITS technologies are deployed worldwide in smart cities, enabling the next generation of ITS relies on effective integration of connected and autonomous vehicles, the two technologies that are under wide field testing in many cities around the world. Even though these two emerging technologies are crucial in enabling fully automated transportation systems, there is still a significant need to automate other road and transportation components. To this end, due to their mobility, autonomous operation, and communication/processing capabilities, UAVs are envisaged in many ITS application domains. This article describes the possible ITS applications that can use UAVs, and highlights the potential and challenges for UAV-enabled ITS for next-generation smart cities.},

Nearly 60{\%} of consumers in cities around the world are willing to travel in self-driving vehicles. In the consumer survey among 5,500 respondents in ten countries, acceptance is highest in emerging markets, such as China, India, and the United Arab Emirates; and about 50{\%} in the United States and the United Kingdom; and acceptance rates were lowest in Japan and Germany. As part of a project, the World Economic Forum also conducted interviews with over 20 city policy makers and transport authorities from cities such as Dubai, Helsinki, New York, Amsterdam, Singapore, and Toronto about their expectations for self-driving vehicles. The survey showed that most city authorities believe that applications such as shared self-driving vehicles are coming very quickly and will have the potential to be the last-mile solution for public transport. City planners and governments thus need to prepare for the introduction of self-driving cars?smart mobility cities such as Gothenburg and Singapore are already doing so.},

All told, major social AV impacts in the form of crash savings, travel time reduction, fuel efficiency and parking benefits are estimated to approach {\$}2000 to per year per AV, and may eventually approach nearly {\$}4000 when comprehensive crash costs are accounted for. Yet barriers to implementation and mass-market penetration remain. Initial costs will likely be unaffordable. Licensing and testing standards in the U.S. are being developed at the state level, rather than nationally, which may lead to inconsistencies across states. Liability details remain undefined, security concerns linger, and without new privacy standards, a default lack of privacy for personal travel may become the norm. The impacts and interactions with other components of the transportation system, as well as implementation details, remain uncertain. To address these concerns, the federal government should expand research in these areas and create a nationally recognized licensing framework for AVs, determining appropriate standards for liability, security, and data privacy.},

abstract = {Carsharing programs that operate as short-term vehicle rentals (often for one-way trips before ending the rental) like Car2Go and ZipCar have quickly expanded, with the number of US users doubling every 1–2years over the past decade. Such programs seek to shift personal transportation choices from an owned asset to a service used on demand. The advent of autonomous or fully self-driving vehicles will address many current carsharing barriers, including users' travel to access available vehicles. This work describes the design of an agent-based model for shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) operations, the results of many case-study applications using this model, and the estimated environmental benefits of such settings, versus conventional vehicle ownership and use. The model operates by generating trips throughout a grid-based urban area, with each trip assigned an origin, destination and departure time, to mimic realistic travel profiles. A preliminary model run estimates the SAV fleet size required to reasonably service all trips, also using a variety of vehicle relocation strategies that seek to minimize future traveler wait times. Next, the model is run over one-hundred days, with driverless vehicles ferrying travelers from one destination to the next. During each 5-min interval, some unused SAVs relocate, attempting to shorten wait times for next-period travelers. Case studies vary trip generation rates, trip distribution patterns, network congestion levels, service area size, vehicle relocation strategies, and fleet size. Preliminary results indicate that each SAV can replace around eleven conventional vehicles, but adds up to 10{\%} more travel distance than comparable non-SAV trips, resulting in overall beneficial emissions impacts, once fleet-efficiency changes and embodied versus in-use emissions are assessed.},

We see a drastic change in autonomous vehicle technology since 1920s, when the first radio controlled vehicles were designed. In the subsequent decades, we see fairly autonomous electric cars powered by embedded circuits in the roads. By 1960s, autonomous cars having similar electronic guide systems came into picture. 1980s saw vision guided autonomous vehicles, which was a major milestone in technology and till date we use similar or modified forms of vision and radio guided technologies. Various semi-autonomous features introduced in modern cars such as lane keeping, automatic braking and adaptive cruise control are based on such systems. Extensive network guided systems in conjunction with vision guided features is the future of autonomous vehicles. It is predicted that most companies will launch fully autonomous vehicles by the advent of next decade. The future of autonomous vehicles is an ambitious era of safe and comfortable transportation.},

abstract = {Systems that enable high levels of vehicle-automation are now beginning to enter the commercial marketplace. Road vehicles capable of operating independently of real-time human control under an increasing set of circumstances will likely become more widely available in the near future. Such vehicles are expected to bring a variety of benefits. Two such anticipated advantages (relative to human-driver vehicle control) are said to be increased road network capacity and the freeing up of the driver-occupant's time to engage in their choice of leisurely or economically-productive (non-driving) tasks.In this study we investigate the implications for intersection capacity and level-of-service of providing occupants of automated (without real-time human control), autonomously-operating (without vehicle-to-X communication) cars with ride quality that is equivalent (in terms of maximum rates of longitudinal and lateral acceleration) to two types of rail systems: [urban] light rail transit and [inter-urban] high-speed rail. The literature suggests that car passengers start experiencing discomfort at lower rates of acceleration than car drivers; it is therefore plausible that occupants of an autonomously-operating vehicle may wish to instruct their vehicle to maneuver in a way that provides them greater ride comfort than if the vehicle-control algorithm simply mimicked human-driving-operation.On the basis of traffic microsimulation analysis, we found that restricting the dynamics of autonomous cars to the acceleration/deceleration characteristics of both rail systems leads to reductions in a signalized intersection's vehicle-processing capacity and increases in delay. The impacts were found to be larger when constraining the autonomous cars' dynamics to the more-restrictive acceleration/deceleration profile of high-speed rail. The scenarios we analyzed must be viewed as boundary conditions, because autonomous cars' dynamics were by definition never allowed to exceed the acceleration/deceleration constraints of the rail systems. Appropriate evidence regarding motorists' preferences does not exist at present; establishing these preferences is an important item for the future research agenda.This paper concludes with a brief discussion of research needs to advance this line of inquiry.},

@article{Andrea2012,
abstract = {K EN invited me to reflect on the automation and robotics innovations that Kiva Systems developed that allow the company to successfully develop and deploy warehouse sys-tems with hundreds -sometimes thousands -of autonomous mobile robots, and to describe some of the remaining research questions. First, a brief history. 1 The central idea behind Kiva Systems -to use hundreds of mobile robots to bring inventory to warehouse workers, and thus save them from walking daily marathons to retrieve them -was conceived by Mick Mountz. Convinced that his vision was not only a great business idea, but also technologically viable (albeit barely), Peter Wurman and I took advantage of our upcoming sabbaticals and joined Mick in his quest to revolutionize distri-bution facilities. Armed with angel investor funds and a well-de-fined objective, we moved into a small warehouse in the Boston area in January of 2004 to build a team and architect the system that would realize this vision. By the time Amazon acquired Kiva in May 2012, it was a 300-person company with a long customer list that included Walgreens, Staples, and Saks, and roughly 30 warehouses de-ployed across Europe and North America. There were many hurdles that we had to overcome, and only a portion of them were technical. For example, convincing es-tablished retailers to embrace a radically different approach to order fulfillment (a competency that is often central to their op-eration); carefully planning and executing product development with limited cash-flow; maintaining an agile company culture focused on satisfying customer needs and wants that were both varied and changing. Arguably the biggest challenge we faced was delivering a technical solution that was both economically viable and robust. In 2003, right at the time that Kiva was getting off the ground, Jennifer Carlson and Robin Murphy published their paper " Re-liability Analysis of Mobile Robots. " (Robotics and Automa-tion, 2003. Proceedings. ICRA'03, IEEE International Confer-ence, 14-19 Sept. 2003.) One of the main conclusions of their research was that the average mean time between failure of mo-bile robots at the time was 8 hours. For a 1000 mobile robot warehouse operating 24/7, this equates to 3000 robot failures per day -an obviously untenable situation. We thus had to in-crease mobile robot reliability by many orders of magnitude. Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/TASE.2012.2214676 1 Please see also " Three Engineers, Hundreds of Robots, One Warehouse, " IEEE Spectrum, July 2008, for an in-depth history and a discussion of the Kiva business model and technology. Kiva Systems achieved this by using one of control en-gineering's most powerful, yet often overlooked, tools: the use of feedback to shift sensitivity. In particular, Kiva uses inexpensive, but very reliable, computation and sensing com-ponents to build a highly reliable system from inexpensive electromechanical components and manufacturing processes. Sensitivity is shifted from the subsystems and processes that are costly to make precise, to components whose accuracy and precision can be ensured at a low cost. This allowed us to design extremely dependable robots that can carry loads ranging from a few kilograms to half a ton, with varying mass distributions, at speeds of up to 5 km/h (typical walking speed), in tight quarters, without hitting each other. Furthermore, by having access to large amounts of data, we were able to design model-based adaptation and learning algorithms that improve the performance of the robots over time, while at the same time providing us with important diagnostics and health metrics. The resulting robust movement infrastructure is leveraged by the multi-agent architecture upon which all high level decisions are made in real time, such as deciding which of the thousands of storage pods should be fetched, which of the hundreds of robots should pick up the pod, and which of the tens of picking stations should be used to fulfill an order. It is in this area where huge benefits can be obtained in a short amount of time: clever algo-rithms can reduce the number of robots needed in a warehouse by 5 to 10{\%} -a cost savings that is hard to achieve with hard-ware innovations alone -with only a fraction of the development costs. The immediate impact of Kiva's success is the adoption of mobile robots in distribution facilities, a multi-billion dollar market. The broader impact, however, is demonstrating that robotics and automation cannot only create new markets, but also revolutionize established ones. Key to our success was that we had first identified a real need based on in-depth market segment knowledge (rather than, like a hammer looking for a nail, trying to find problems to solve with a technology we had invented). We also had the technical skills to create and execute on a product vision, we had the willingness to unequivocally commit to bringing a product to market, and last but not least, we had a little bit of luck and good timing. I'd also like to propose three broader goals for our research community. The first is to collectively define the standards for -and co-develop -an indoor position system (IPS) that robots can use. Its impact will be broader than that of GPS for outdoor environments (and not just for robots), as most human activity takes place indoors. Imagine what types of systems we could build if we had the IPS equivalent of the low-cost, low-weight,},

Thereafter, the maps were generated that describe what waste fraction comes from where and how it is collected. Finally, a preliminary analysis of the route efficiency was conducted. Maps of selected vehicle routes were constructed in detail and the efficiencies of the routes for the first half of July 2013 were assessed using the efficiency index (kg waste/km).

Girardet discusses the work that has been done in established cities such as Heidelberg in Germany, Adelaide in Australia and Waking in the UK, as well as the pioneering efforts that are being undertaken in eco-cities such as Donglan, near Shanghai, where an entire metropolis is being built from scratch for half a million inhabitants."--BOOK JACKET.},

abstract = {Ever growing populations in cities are associated with a major increase in road vehicles and air pollution. The overall high levels of urban air pollution have been shown to be of a significant risk to city dwellers. However, the impacts of very high but temporally and spatially restricted pollution, and thus exposure, are still poorly understood. Conventional approaches to air quality monitoring are based on networks of static and sparse measurement stations. However, these are prohibitively expensive to capture tempo-spatial heterogeneity and identify pollution hotspots, which is required for the development of robust real-time strategies for exposure control. Current progress in developing low-cost micro-scale sensing technology is radically changing the conventional approach to allow real-time information in a capillary form. But the question remains whether there is value in the less accurate data they generate. This article illustrates the drivers behind current rises in the use of low-cost sensors for air pollution management in cities, while addressing the major challenges for their effective implementation.},

It discusses autonomous vehicle benefits and costs, predicts their likely development and implementation based on experience with previous vehicle technologies, and explores how they will affect planning decisions such as optimal road, parking and public transit supply. The analysis indicates that some benefits, such as independent mobility for affluent non-drivers, may begin in the 2020s or 2030s, but most impacts, including reduced traffic and parking congestion (and therefore road and parking facility supply requirements), independent mobility for low-income people (and therefore reduced need to subsidize transit), increased safety, energy conservation and pollution reductions, will only be significant when autonomous vehicles become common and affordable, probably in the 2040s to 2060s, and some benefits may require prohibiting human-driven vehicles on certain roadways, which could take longer.},

abstract = {Mobile robots range from the teleoperated Sojourner on the Mars Pathfinder mission to cleaning robots in the Paris Metro. Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots offers students and other interested readers an overview of the technology of mobilitythe mechanisms that allow a mobile robot to move through a real world environment to perform its tasksincluding locomotion, sensing, localization, and motion planning. It discusses all facets of mobile robotics, including hardware design, wheel design, kinematics analysis, sensors and perception, localization, mapping, and robot control architectures.The design of any successful robot involves the integration of many different disciplines, among them kinematics, signal analysis, information theory, artificial intelligence, and probability theory. Reflecting this, the book presents the techniques and technology that enable mobility in a series of interacting modules. Each chapter covers a different aspect of mobility, as the book moves from low-level to high-level details. The first two chapters explore low-level locomotory ability, examining robots' wheels and legs and the principles of kinematics. This is followed by an in-depth view of perception, including descriptions of many "off-the-shelf" sensors and an analysis of the interpretation of sensed data. The final two chapters consider the higher-level challenges of localization and cognition, discussing successful localization strategies, autonomous mapping, and navigation competence. Bringing together all aspects of mobile robotics into one volume, Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots can serve as a textbook for coursework or a working tool for beginners in the field.},

abstract = {This contribution presents a novel approach for efficient online planning of topologically distinctive mobile robot trajectories. Trajectory optimization deforms an initial coarse path drafted by a global planner with respect to robot motion related objectives and constraints. The primary objective is to reach a goal state in minimal time on a collision free path that adheres to the kinematic and dynamic constraints of the mobile robot. Conventional local planners get often stuck in a local optimal trajectory as they are unable to transit across obstacles. Our approach seeks the globally optimal trajectory as it maintains and optimizes a subset of admissible candidate tra-jectories of distinctive topologies in parallel. In case of dynamic environments the planner switches to the current globally opti-mal trajectory among the candidate set. The online trajectory planning with timed elastic bands is tightly integrated with the robot motion feedback control. The comparative analysis with conventional local planners confirms the advantages of maintaining distinctive topologies to circumnavigate dynamic obstacles.},

abstract = {In this study, we develop a central profile-based 3D face pose estimation algorithm. The central profile is a unique curve on a 3D face surface that starts from forehead center, goes down through nose ridge, nose tip, mouth center, and ends at a chin tip. The points on the central profile are co-planar and belong to a symmetry plane that separates human face into two identical parts. The central profile is protrusive and has a certain length. Most importantly, the normal vectors of the central profile points are parallel to the symmetry plane. Based on the properties of the central profile, Hough transform is employed to determine the symmetry plane by invoking a voting procedure. An objective function is introduced in the parameter space to quantify the vote importance for face profile points and map the central profile to an accumulator cell with the maximal value. Subsequently, a nose model matching algorithm is used to detect nose tip on the central profile. A pitch angle estimation algorithm is also proposed. The pose estimation experiments completed for a synthetic 3D face model and the FRGC v2.0 3D database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pose estimation algorithm. The obtained central profile detection rate is 99.9{\%}, and the nose tip detection rate has reached 98.16{\%} with error not larger than 10 mm. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Localization is an essential component for autonomous robots. A well-established localization approach combines ray casting with a particle filter, leading to a computationally expensive algorithm that is difficult to run on resource-constrained mobile robots. We present a novel data structure called the Compressed Directional Distance Transform for accelerating ray casting in two dimensional occupancy grid maps. Our approach allows online map updates, and near constant time ray casting performance for a fixed size map, in contrast with other methods which exhibit poor worst case performance. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm approximates the performance characteristics of reading from a three dimensional lookup table of ray cast solutions while requiring two orders of magnitude less memory and precomputation. This results in a particle filter algorithm which can maintain 2500 particles with 61 ray casts per particle at 40Hz, using a single CPU thread onboard a mobile robot.},

Especially for the second task laser scanners are the sensor of choice as they provide precise range measurements. This work proposes an approach for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) specifically designed for the Velodyne HDL-64E laser scanner which exhibits characteristics not present in most other systems. This comprises the continuous, spinning data acquisition and the relative high sensor noise. Together, these make standard SLAM approaches generate noisy maps and inaccurate trajectories. We show that it is possible to generate precise maps and localize therein in spite of not using wheel speed sensors or other information. The presented approach is evaluated on a novel, challenging 3D data set being made publicly available.},

In this paper, we present a novel approach that instead uses geo-tagged panoramas from the Google Street View as a source of global positioning. We model the problem of localization as a non-linear least squares estimation in two phases. The first estimates the 3D position of tracked feature points from short monocular camera sequences. The second computes the rigid body transformation between the Street View panoramas and the estimated points. The only input of this approach is a stream of monocular camera images and odometry estimates. We quantified the accuracy of the method by running the approach on a robotic platform in a parking lot by using visual fiducials as ground truth. Additionally, we applied the approach in the context of personal localization in a real urban scenario by using data from a Google Tango tablet.},
