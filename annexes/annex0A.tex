\chapter{Setup recommendations}

Setting up a system like the PEV can take up days or even weeks. In this annex some configuration recommendations will be given in order to speed up the process. This setup is not specific for the platforms of this thesis, but it is highly adaptable to many other kinds of platforms.

The documents included in this annex are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Writing hardware rules.
  \item Organizing ROS workspaces.
  \item Connecting multiple machines over ROS.
  \item Installing OpenCV, CUDA and Tensorflow.
\end{itemize}
