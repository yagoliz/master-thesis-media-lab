\chapter*{Abstract}
\textbf{Self--driving vehicles} will be a reality in the not so distant future of cities. Much of the attention today is focused on cars, although they face great challenges in years to come before their implementation, thus creating an ample spot for lightweight alternatives to blossom. This thesis is about one of those alternatives, the \textbf{Persuasive Electric Vehicle}, and the approaches taken to overcome the problems autonomous vehicles have. Specially interesting is the problem of \textbf{Simultaneous Localization and Mapping} due to its complexity and possibilities it opens to achieve fully autonomous platforms. In the chapters that follow, the reader will find how it was tackled, what are the results employing different techniques and how it could be improved so that autonomous lightweight vehicles can start to be seen on the streets of our cities.\bigskip
